# Data-Analyst-Intern-at-Elevate-Labs-Task-3
Worked on designing an interactive Dashboard in Tableau for business stakeholders, starting with the dataset (Ecommerce_Product_Sales.csv). The goal was to visualize key performance indicators like total revenue, profit, and units sold, along with time-series trends and product/category performance. To support this, I drafted a professional PowerPoint summary outlining the objectives, insights, and dashboard structure. Added filters for interactivity and consistent design themes. All design and visuals were clearly defined in the Task 3 pdf for easy implementation in Tableau Desktop.
